# image-uploading-website

A very basic image upload & share website.

I made this when I was learning PHP It's one of my first projects. ( The css is probably poor so I advice you to change it If you're gonna use this website)

I don't know if I will host this website but if it's still alive you can go check it out from here ! : [ImgBase.xyz](https://www.imgbase.xyz/)

## Website

This is a very basic image upload & share website like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) for storing or sharing image files.

## How to use ?

Drag & drop or click and select the files you want to upload and it will generate an php page with the image , a link to copy & share.
Also it will provide an codeblock (img tag with link) for developers to copy and paste to ther website's html...

## Copyright ?

You can use this however you want ! 

You do not need to contribute ! if you want to contribute (and star) feel free to do it :)
